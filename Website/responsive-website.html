          <br>
        <p>The purpose of this project was to code a website and have its top priority of being a mobile first website, meaning that it would adjust to fit smaller screens while keeping its functionality and visual appearance intact. The theme that I was given for this project was 8-bit art. I used 8-bit styled fonts to create the 8-bit artstyle feel, as well as only using simple colours which you would see in 8-bit styled artwork and video games. </p> <br><br>
        <p>Media queries were used to make sure that the website would be responsive on mobile phones, and also to change the navbar to contain a burger menu consisting of all the elements in the navbar.</p>
