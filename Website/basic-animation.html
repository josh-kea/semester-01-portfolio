        <p>This project is based on the art style that we were given - <b>Russian Constructivism</b>. Our group consisted of 5 people to create this. I specialized in doing the coding for this animation. We chose to go with a famous scene from Harry Potter as we thought there were many chained events we could use for an animation. The animation consists of spritesheets and images created in Adobe Illustrator & Adobe Photoshop. The sounds and voices were created with Audactiy. <br><br> For the Javascript I added IsClicked() functions holding boolean variables to the characters to keep track of what animation should go next based on how many of the EventListener elements were clicked. The story ends once all elements that are clickable are clicked. The animations were created from scratch in CSS, and all elements in the animation frame are placed with a z-index to bring it to life. </p> <br><br>
