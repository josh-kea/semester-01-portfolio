        <p>No words were used in the creation of this video. The story is displayed merely with an emotional soundtrack and strong facial expressions to show that this is a sad story of two young (students) who both have their own personal issues. Eventually, they both end up at the same place, even though they have not met each other before. This creates a great climatic point that even though they have their differences, they still have similarities.
