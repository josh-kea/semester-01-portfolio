        <p>The task for our group was to create a promotional campaign video and website for tourists and newcomers to Copenhagen, the basic rules on using Bicycles in the city. <br><br>
        Our concept is to show the rules of using a bicycle while also having a voiceover explaining these different rules as the video proceeds. I was the actor for this video and provided some voiceover material during the post-production process.
