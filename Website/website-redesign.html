        <p>The purpose of this project was to redesign an outdated website in order to make it responsive and more visually appealing. Our group was tasked with redesigning a website for a restaurant named Martyr's Bay. We chose to go with a more modern look, using mostly black and white, as well as using fonts that displayed a more elegant feel when read. I coded the website using grids, with more grids inside of grids to easily place elements. A media query was used to make sure that the website is responsive.</p>
